*In order to use your NYM tokens, you must acquire some and have your NYM wallet ready. If you havenâ€™t done so, make sure to finish [level 1 tasks first.](Minymja%20-%20NYM%20token%20holder%204ad2202a8e504c3dbee6a0a30bd33213.md)*

Level 2 isnâ€™t quite as straightforward as level 1 has been, but rest assured: weâ€™ve all been exactly in your shoes ðŸ˜‰ ****

Time to explore, learn, and share with each other!

Utility tokens give you access to services that the Nym infrastructure provides. We find it super interesting that all the ways you can currently use NYM tokens gives you the opportunity to gently shape the infrastructure of the internet as a user (youâ€™ll hopefully see what we mean).

- In the future, youâ€™ll need NYM tokens to **use the mixnet services**, just like how you would usually pay for a VPN. (At the moment connecting is free ðŸ™‚, [download NymConnect](https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/) and [use this tutorial](https://youtu.be/quj8H2qeOwY) to learn how you can set it up for current clients: Telegram/Electrum/Keybase).
    - Some of the early Nym services include **messaging and chat apps**, like pastnym. Keep an eye out for these as they get released.
- You can use your NYM tokens to **delegate to a mixnode** and get a share of their rewards. This means you can choose the mixnode which your computer and gateway will connect to. You can choose based on available information about their performance and services. Check out [Nymâ€™s mixnode explorer](https://explorer.nymtech.net) to get a sense of who current mixnode operators are.
- Setting up a mixnode yourself will involve **bonding NYM tokens**, this happens inside the Nym wallet.
- You can also use NYM tokens to bond and **set up a gateway**, which serves as the main interface for users connecting to the Nym network (fun fact: itâ€™s the only element of the Nym infrastructure which will know your IP address, and the nature of the infrastructure is built in a way so it shields this from malicious actors who could either be posing as gateways or other actors).

Weâ€™re super excited by all the details behind Nymâ€™s infrastructure. Keep an eye out for the next piece on our favourite parts about the tokenomics.

Ciao!
