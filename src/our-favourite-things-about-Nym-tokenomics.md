# Our favourite things about Nym’s tokenomics (draft)

- 2 explorers (mixnet/blockchain) and two options [NYM](https://explorer.nymtech.net) and [Node guru](https://mixnet.explorers.guru)
- coint distr. model (sustainable) Pie chart (percentage to mixnodes, backers, team etc), reserve and community (reward pool), mixmining there until nodes take care of themselves (long runway - time to absorb/learn)
- Vesting schedule (slow release) filters out shitty players, slow (graph)
- ICO sale somewhat, reward investors/backers
- Freedom to delegate and foster relationship/familiarity (strengthens)
- No entry/exit risk (it’s multi-hop)

Questions: what do PoS staking nodes/farms need in terms of hardware? what is “in jail”?

How is it more effective to delegate to one mixnode than multiple? (why are you rewarded higher?) is it strengthening trust and nurturing bonds or is it about less action on the network?
