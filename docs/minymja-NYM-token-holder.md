# Minymja - NYM token holder

The next level of privacy infrastructure is here: itâ€™s decentralised, scalable and accessible. The time is now - to invest in a safe future for yourself and for the wider collective. 

It takes a bit of work (as all good things do), but as recent users weâ€™re super excited to help you spark your first interaction with the NYM token. This will pave the way for you to explore some of the early Nym infrastructure. 

Remember â€” privacy isnâ€™t easy, we live in a very connected, networked world and weâ€™re going to need each other to learn how to properly secure ourselves as things evolve. If you havenâ€™t already, check out the [Nym whitepaper](https://nymtech.net/research/) for a comprehensive overview.

Ready to get started? Letâ€™s go:

We used Kraken since itâ€™s currently the only centralised exchange (CEX) which integrates directly with NymChain. You can purchase native NYM tokens straight away, instead of the alternative (bridging your NYM tokens through Gravity). In a matter of minutes youâ€™ll be ready with tokens to delegate and bond

1) Register or login to your account on [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com)

2) Trade or buy NYM using the currency of your choice. For crypto look for Deposit under the *Funding* tab, and if you want to use fiat look for the big Buy button.

3) Calculate how much youâ€™ll need: itâ€™s 100 NYM to bond your own mixnode, about 1-2 NYM to transfer/transact from exchanges and other Nymchain transactions. We recommend at least a minimum amount of 103 NYM.

4) Download the [NYM wallet](https://nymtech.net/download-nym-wallet/) to set it up. Note: take safety precautions, donâ€™t forget to write up your mnemonic phrase and keep it somewhere very safe. We recommend taking the time you need here to seriously assess your own security strategy, remember: not your keys, not your tokens.

5) Transfer the shiny new NYM tokens from Kraken to your public NYM address. For some fun, watch how fast it happens live on the [chain explorer](https://nym.explorers.guru/blocks).

6) Either delegate your tokens to existing mixnodes (browse the list and find one you like here: [https://explorer.nymtech.net/network-components/mixnodes/](https://explorer.nymtech.net/network-components/mixnodes/)) or go hard and get ready to bond them to your own mixnode. In this case follow the next guide!
